        <p> Hi there folks! I can’t believe it’s finally happened and we have our own website! (Talk about late to the
          party.) When my grandfather started this store in 1947 (Called the Old country bakery) I don’t think he would
          have imagined not only it
          lasting this
          long but also the way the store as grown. He’d also being asking “What’s a website?” and “Who are you?” (I
          sadly never
          got to meet him.) But anywho! So yes, a new website! While it’s a little bare bone right now, I think it’s a
          great
          starting off point for us as we didn’t have one before. I can’t wait to see what everyone thinks of this
          site! </p>
